Hello! Welcome to my repo. The intention of this project was to learn how to use Machine Learning libraries, apply what I am learning in the research papers that I read and have fun!!!


The following link is a short video where I present myself

# NEAT_2048_solver
Reinforcement Learning approach to solving the game of 2048 using the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) Genetic Algorithm.

Based on the following paper: 
https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

Using the neat library

# 3 possible actions:

play 2048 as a user

train the ai

run a trained ai
